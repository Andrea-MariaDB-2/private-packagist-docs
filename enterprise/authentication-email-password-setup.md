# Authentication with email and password
## Private Packagist Enterprise

## Setup
By default authentication with email and password is disabled, and we recommend setting up one of the OAuth options only if they are available.

Navigate to the "Global Configuration" section from the admin page to get to the form below.
Enable login and account registration with email addresses and passwords by selecting the option in the form and submitting the form via the "Update configuration" button.
