# GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab and Other Integrations
## Synchronization of Users, Teams, Permissions and Repositories

Composer has broad support for version control systems, code hosting platforms and authentication protocols. As a consequence **Private Packagist is compatible with all the same systems and platforms**, namely Git, Mercurial or Subversion using SSH access, HTTP Basic Auth over SSL, or their native protocols.

To simplify the initial setup and maintenance of a Private Packagist account, we offer optional synchronization for GitHub organizations, Bitbucket teams and GitLab groups. This **integration keeps teams, their members, and access permissions in sync** with a matching GitHub organization. So you only need to manage users and permissions in a single place.

You can log into Private Packagist using an account on GitHub.com, Bitbucket.org, or GitLab.com. If you already have an account you can connect these services to your existing account on your [profile page](https://packagist.com/profile).

You can then either create a new organization directly synchronized with a GitHub organization, Bitbucket team or a GitLab group, or you can enable synchronization for an existing Organization in _Settings_.

Apart from synchronizing teams, users, and permissions, setting up the integration will simplify the addition of new packages to your Composer repository. When you create a **new repository** on GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, it will be **added as a Composer package automatically** if it contains a _composer.json_ file. If youâ€™d like to add existing repositories as packages, you can do so with the click of a button on the Packages tab in your organization.

**Update web hooks** notifying Packagist of new code pushes will be installed in the background, and **credentials to access the package** will be **configured automatically**.
